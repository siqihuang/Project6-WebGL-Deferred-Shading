#Part O: Browser Setup
This should be a very easy part, as many browser nowadays support WebGl 1.0 or higher. But in my case I still have problems and spend a whole day dealing with it. First I tried to use Chrome but it seems that it only support WebGl 1.0. To enable the WebGl 2.0, you have to add parameter in its command line[1]. This method work fine in majority of time, but unlucky I am not in that range, so I turn to FireFox and setup the browser for WebGl.
